# Images structure

## Pods
Each pod has its own folder inside `/pods`.

Images in each pod folder may be used for:
- pod listing cards
- pod detail pages
- pod-specific experiences

## Experiences
Each experience theme has its own folder inside `/experiences`.

Images here are shared across the website and may be reused in different sections.

## Notes
Image names are not final and may be renamed later when integrating the final website.
