## 1. What is PurePods

PurePods is a collection of unique accommodation experiences set in the natural landscapes of New Zealand.  
It is not a traditional hotel, nor a standard tourist accommodation.

The PurePods experience is based on a deep and personal immersion in nature, designed to slow down, disconnect and experience the landscape in an intimate and mindful way.

PurePods are glass eco-cabins, fully integrated into their surroundings, allowing guests to experience nature through all five senses — light, sound, weather, night skies and the ever-changing landscape — even from inside the pod.

The experience is defined by:
- complete privacy and true seclusion  
- a direct connection with nature  
- calm, silence and a strong sense of refuge  
- minimalist, functional design that respects the environment  
- stargazing directly from bed  
- an experience primarily designed for couples  

Although nature is always present (rain, wind, cold, heat), guests remain safe, warm and comfortable, without losing their connection to the outside world.

Sustainability is an essential part of the PurePods concept:
- responsible use of resources  
- sensitive integration with the land  
- collaboration with local landowners to support conservation and protect natural landscapes  

The website must convey exclusivity, simplicity and respect for the environment.  
It should never feel commercial or promotional, but calm, honest and experience-led.
